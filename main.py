number = 7# declares and initilizes a variable called number and assigned the value 7
print("I'm thinking of a number, can you guess it?")#output a message to use to prompt an input 
guess = int(input())#declares and initilizes a variable called guess and assigns it the value of the input
while guess != number:# if the number is not equal to the guess it will trigger the loop
  print("Wrong! Guess again!") # output the message that the user guessed wrong 
  guess = input() #The user input will be assigned to the guess variable
print("You guessed it!")#Outside the loop it will output the message you guessed it

# Give the line number where iteration starts.

# What does '!=' mean?
  # Answer: The operator "!=" means not equal to in python. 

# How many variables are there in the code?

# How can you tell which lines of code are inside the loop?
  # Answer: You can tell that Lines 5 and 6 are in the code because they are indented which shows that something is in the loop.

# How many times will the loop repeat?
  # Answer: The loop will repeat as long as the value in the variable guess is not the same as the value in the variable number. 

# What has to happen to make the program run the last line of code?
  # Answer: The while loop has to be proven false so it ends and the last line of code will run.
